        Medicine and Cancer (IBMC)</b> is the Chinese Academy of
      Sciencesâ€™ first institute explicitly devoted to the research and
      development of medicine. By partnering with the Zhejiang Cancer
      Hospital, we address real medical problems. IBMC is home to a
      highly collaborative group of scientists and medical doctors who
      work on solving fundamental questions in the fields of omics and
      oncology for the advancement of diagnostics and therapeutics. With
      a focus on clinical needs and problems, IBMC is committed to
      solving fundamental issues in tumor diagnosis, targeted treatment,
      novel drug R&amp;D, and smart healthcare, as well as basic and
      applied research related to the diagnosis, treatment, prevention
      and control of major diseases. We aim to be a world-class tumor
      medicine research center integrating advanced disciplines,
      training programs for talents, and an incubator for industry
      applications. IBMC is also the first national life and health
      research institute introduced in beautiful Zhejiang Province.
      Through our strategic collaborations, our talented team strives to
      make fundamental breakthroughs in cancer diagnostics and
      treatment. <br>
